	abstract = {Resolution, high signal intensity and elevated signal to noise ratio (SNR) are key issues for biologists who aim at studying the localisation of biological structures at the cellular and subcellular levels using confocal microscopy. The resolution required to separate sub-cellular biological structures is often near to the resolving power of the microscope. When optimally used, confocal microscopes may reach resolutions of 180 nm laterally and 500 nm axially, however, axial resolution in depth is often impaired by spherical aberration that may occur due to refractive index mismatches. Spherical aberration results in broadening of the point-spread function (PSF), a decrease in peak signal intensity when imaging in depth and a focal shift that leads to the distortion of the image along the z-axis and thus in a scaling error. In this study, we use the novel mounting medium CFM3 (Citifluor Ltd., UK) with a refractive index of 1.518 to minimize the effects of spherical aberration. This mounting medium is compatible with most common fluorochromes and fluorescent proteins. We compare its performance with established mounting media, harbouring refractive indices below 1.500, by estimating lateral and axial resolution with sub-resolution fluorescent beads. We show furthermore that the use of the high refractive index media renders the tissue transparent and improves considerably the axial resolution and imaging depth in immuno-labelled or fluorescent protein labelled fixed mouse brain tissue. We thus propose to use those novel high refractive index mounting media, whenever optimal axial resolution is required.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes resolution in optical microscopy. Optical microscopes are fundamentally limited in the resolution they can achieve. The resolution depends on the wavelength of the light (both incident and detected), on the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical arrangement, and on the specimen to be observed or the experiment to be performed. Live specimens are also dynamic and sensitive to photobleaching and thermal damage, which imposes a limit on the duration for which they can be observed and on the power of the incident light. Fluorescence is excited throughout its illumination cone, but only fluorescence emitted from the focal point is imaged through the confocal pinhole to the detector. A useful tool for comparing the performance of optical microscopes is the point-spread function (PSF). The PSF can be defined in two complementary. The intensity PSF (hereafter referred to simply as the PSF) can be measured by taking images of—for example, a subresolution bead as it is scanned through the focus of a microscope. Real specimens are, of course, rarely point sources.},
